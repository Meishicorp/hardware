# Business Ledger Design
This project aims at developing an open source -non custodial- hardware ledger for securing and exchanging IDs based on NFC and detecting close people using Blutooth Mesh. 

IDs will be stored in a distributed cloud architecture (Cloud Database or Digital Ledger Technology other than Blockchain).

IDs will be exchanged based on the mechanisms of smart contracts or realtime programming. 

This project is intended to be commercialised. This design would be sold to card manufacturers so that customers can request external customizations (color, logo, material, etc.) based on their own preference.
